Page Grid is an add-on that lets you draw a grid layout on any page.  

It renders an adjustable grid on the page (active tab). You can the grid position (X/Y), color, size, order (z-index), and line width via the options page. Reloading the active tab or pressing the toolbar button again will remove the grid from the page. This addon is very light and does not have any background activities.
